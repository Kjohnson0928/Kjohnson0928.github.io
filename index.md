<h1>Hello, professor!</h1>
<h2>Here's the analytics projects i've been apart of in my MBA program:</h2>
<ul> BIDA 640: Big Data and Web Intelligence</ul>
  <p>In this course, my group and I conducted research on how business analytics could be beneficial to small to medium sized businesses. We also, highlighted why these types of businesses are either hesitant to incorporate business intelligence tools  or suffer from departmental woes because of their lack of knowledge in how to effectively use analytic tools.</p>
  
  <ul>BIDA 650: Business Analytics</ul>
   <p>In this course, we created a project using prescriptive and predictive analysis. My group and I, leveraged the data of a small medical practice to analyze the effects that COVID-19 had on the business through looking at the number of in-person patient visits in 2018-2019 vs 2020. We wanted to paint a picture of the financial hindrance that the medical practice to possibly endure if they did not increase the number of in-person patient visits again.</p>

<ul>BIDA 660: Executive Analytics With SAP BI</ul>
  <p>In this course, we utilized SAP BI to generate information and knowledge to make informed decisons. In this individual project, I conducted a case study for a mock company that would help in making informed decisions based on the data provided to them. Some things I did in this project was raw data analysis, restructuring data for geographical mapping and forecasting, and creating user-friendly data visualizations</p>
  
<ul>BIDA 670: Advanced Analytics Project</ul>
  <p>In my current course, my teammate and I, </p>
